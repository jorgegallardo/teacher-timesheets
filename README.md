# TeacherTimesheets

**Overview** üåé </br>
The teacher-timesheet repository essentially lends a hand in expediting the timesheet procedure of calculating teachers' attendance in training and professional developments. By digitizing the process of receiving the teacher's information and producing completed electronic timesheets will reduce user errors allowing employees to optimize their time.

**Technologies Implemented** ‚öôÔ∏è </br>
Elaborating on the technologies associated with the project, we will be using **Anguar** for the frontend to prompt teachers for their information. For the backend, **Python** will generate the completed timesheet in PDF format with the assistance (insert name of libraries).
